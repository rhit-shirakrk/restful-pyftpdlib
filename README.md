# Dependencies

This mock RESTful server is build using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) and [Flask-RESTful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

To install these libraries (and any other external dependencies), run

`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Note, I assume that whoever is trying to run this server is connected to
Rose-Hulman's VM and is trying to run the server in the VM.
